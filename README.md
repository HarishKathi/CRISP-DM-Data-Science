# Spark Funds Investment Analysis

## Project Overview:

Welcome to the Spark Funds Investment Analysis project! In this assignment, we work for Spark Funds, an asset management company aiming to make strategic investments globally. The primary objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and investment types for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where most other investors are investing, with a focus on countries where English is an official language.

## Business and Data Understanding:

Spark Funds has outlined two key constraints for investments:
1. Investment between 5 to 15 million USD per round.
2. Investments limited to English-speaking countries.

For a country to be considered English speaking, English must be one of its official languages. A list of such countries is available [https://github.com/HarishKathi/CRISP-DM-Data-Science/blob/main/Data/companies.txt](link-to-list-of-countries).
